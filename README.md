# orb-artifactory

CircleCI Orb created in partnership with jFrog.

## Features

This orb will support the major features of the [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory)

To limit the permutations of variables, advanced use cases must pass a [`specs` file.](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-UsingFileSpecs)
