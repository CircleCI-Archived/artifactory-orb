  Use the `docker-publish` job to build and tag a Docker image, then
  push it to a JFrog Docker registry. This example includes a custom
  value for `docker-steps`, which allows you to override the default
  `docker build` logic. The value passed to the `docker-tag` parameter
  is  automatically stored as a job environment variable called
  `$DOCKERTAG`, so make sure to include that env var in your custom
  `docker build` logic.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    artifactory: circleci/artifactory@1.0.0

  workflows:
    custom-docker-example:
      jobs:
        - artifactory/docker-publish:
            name: Docker Publish Custom Build
            docker-registry: orbdemos-docker-local.jfrog.io
            repository: docker-local
            docker-tag: orbdemos-docker-local.jfrog.io/hello-world-custom:1.0-${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}
            docker-steps:
              - run: docker build -t $DOCKERTAG docker-publish-assets
